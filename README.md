# Feedback Categorization using AI (OpenAI)

[Leia em PortuguÃªs](README_PT.md)



## Objective

This POC aims to categorize customer comments using OpenAI.

A analysis will be done based on the text of the comment to assign a specific category that best describes the feedback.

The categories considered are:

- **ATTENDANCE**
- **PAYMENT**
- **COMFORT**
- **WAITING_TIME**
- **PRODUCT**
- **PRODUCT_AVAILABILITY**
- **PRICE**
- **PRODUCT_QUALITY**
- **COMPLIMENT**
- **NONE**
- **INTERESTS**
- **FINANCIAL_PRODUCTS**

</br>
</br>

The `category` property in the object will be filled by the IA after the analysis of the comment.

| Input (comment) | Output (category) |
|----------|----------|
| I was very well attended by the sellers, all friendly and helpful.  | ATTENDANCE  |
| The store is well organized and comfortable, I liked the spacious area.  | COMFORT  |
| I bought a shoe that had a defect, but it was replaced quickly.  | PRODUCT_QUALITY  |

A log will be generated with the number of tokens used and the cost in dollars, as below:

- The categorization logic is separated in the controller module.


## Environment Configuration and Application Initialization

### Prerequisites: 

- Python 3.3+
- Get an api-key from the OpenAI site - https://platform.openai.com/api-keys


### 1. Create and activate the virtual environment

```
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the application 

```
cd app
